       _H_u_n_s_p_e_l_l is fashioned after the _I_s_p_e_l_l program.  The most common  usage
       is "hunspell" or "hunspell filename".  Without filename parameter, hun‐
       spell checks the standard input.  Typing "cat" and  "exsample"  in  two
       input  lines, we got an asterisk (it means "cat" is a correct word) and
       a line with corrections:

              $ hunspell -d en_US
              Hunspell 1.2.3
              *
              & exsample 4 0: example, examples, ex sample, ex-sample

       Correct words signed with an '*', '+' or '-', unrecognized words signed
       with '#' or '&' in output lines (see later).  (Close the standard input
       with Ctrl-d on Unix/Linux and Ctrl-Z Enter or Ctrl-C on Windows.)

       With filename parameters, _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l will display each word of the  files
       which  does  not  appear in the dictionary at the top of the screen and
       allow you to change it.  If there are "near misses" in the  dictionary,
       then  they  are  also  displayed on following lines.  Finally, the line
       containing the word and the previous line are printed at the bottom  of
       the  screen.   If  your terminal can display in reverse video, the word
       itself is highlighted.  You have the option of replacing the word  com‐
       pletely,  or  choosing  one of the suggested words. Commands are single
       characters as follows (case is ignored):

              R      Replace the misspelled word completely.

              Space  Accept the word this time only.

              A      Accept the word for the rest of this _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l session.

              I      Accept the word, capitalized as it is in  the  file,  and
                     update private dictionary.

              U      Accept  the word, and add an uncapitalized (actually, all
                     lower-case) version to the private dictionary.

              S      Ask a stem and a model word and store them in the private
                     dictionary.   The  stem  will  be  accepted also with the
                     affixes of the model word.

              0-_n    Replace with one of the suggested words.

              X      Write the rest of this file, ignoring  misspellings,  and
                     start next file.

              Q      Exit immediately and leave the file unchanged.

              ^Z     Suspend hunspell.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --11     Check only first field in lines (delimiter = tabulator).

       --aa     The --aa option is intended to be used from other programs through
              a pipe.  In this mode, _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l prints a one-line version  iden‐
              tification message, and then begins reading lines of input.  For
              each input line, a single line is written to the standard output
              for each word checked for spelling on the line.  If the word was
              found in the main dictionary, or your personal dictionary,  then
              the  line  contains  only  a '*'.  If the word was found through
              affix removal, then the line contains a '+', a  space,  and  the
              root  word.   If  the  word was found through compound formation
              (concatenation of two words, then the line contains only a '-'.

              If the word is not in the dictionary, but there are near misses,
              then  the  line contains an '&', a space, the misspelled word, a
              space, the number of  near  misses,  the  number  of  characters
              between  the beginning of the line and the beginning of the mis‐
              spelled word, a colon, another space, and a  list  of  the  near
              misses separated by commas and spaces.

              Also,  each  near  miss  or guess is capitalized the same as the
              input word unless such capitalization is illegal; in the  latter
              case  each  near  miss is capitalized correctly according to the
              dictionary.

              Finally, if the word does not  appear  in  the  dictionary,  and
              there are no near misses, then the line contains a '#', a space,
              the misspelled word, a space, and the character offset from  the
              beginning  of  the  line.  Each sentence of text input is termi‐
              nated with an additional blank line,  indicating  that  _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l
              has completed processing the input line.

              These output lines can be summarized as follows:

              OK:    *

              Root:  + <root>

              Compound:
                     -

              Miss:  & <original> <count> <offset>: <miss>, <miss>, ...

              None:  # <original> <offset>

              For  example,  a  dummy  dictionary containing the words "fray",
              "Frey",  "fry",  and  "refried"  might  produce  the   following
              response to the command "echo 'frqy refries | hunspell -a":
              (#) Hunspell 0.4.1 (beta), 2005-05-26
              & frqy 3 0: fray, Frey, fry
              & refries 1 5: refried

              This  mode is also suitable for interactive use when you want to
              figure out the spelling of  a  single  word  (but  this  is  the
              default behavior of hunspell without -a, too).

              When  in  the --aa mode, _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l will also accept lines of single
              words prefixed with any of '*', '&', '@', '+',  '-',  '~',  '#',
              '!',  '%', '`', or '^'.  A line starting with '*' tells _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l
              to insert the word into the user's dictionary (similar to the  I
              command).   A line starting with '&' tells _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l to insert an
              all-lowercase version of the word  into  the  user's  dictionary
              (similar  to  the  U  command).  A line starting with '@' causes
              _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l to accept this word in the future  (similar  to  the  A
              command).  A line starting with '+', followed immediately by tteexx
              or nnrrooffff will cause _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l to parse future input according the
              syntax  of  that  formatter.   A line consisting solely of a '+'
              will place _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l in TeX/LaTeX mode (similar to the --tt option)
              and '-' returns _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l to nroff/troff mode (but these commands
              are obsolete).   However,  the  string  character  type  is  _n_o_t
              changed; the '~' command must be used to do this.  A line start‐
              ing with '~' causes _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l to set internal parameters (in par‐
              ticular,  the  default string character type) based on the file‐
              name given in the rest of the line.  (A file  suffix  is  suffi‐
              cient,  but the period must be included.  Instead of a file name
              or suffix, a unique name, as listed in the language affix  file,
              may  be  specified.)   However,  the  formatter  parsing  is _n_o_t
              changed;  the '+' command must be used to change the  formatter.
              A  line  prefixed with '#' will cause the personal dictionary to
              be saved.  A line prefixed with '!' will turn on _t_e_r_s_e mode (see
              below),  and  a  line  prefixed with '%' will return _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l to
              normal (non-terse) mode.  A line prefixed with '`' will turn  on
              verbose-correction  mode (see below); this mode can only be dis‐
              abled by turning on terse mode with '%'.

              Any input following the prefix characters '+',  '-',  '#',  '!',
              '%',  or  '`' is ignored, as is any input following the filename
              on a '~' line.  To allow spell-checking of lines beginning  with
              these  characters,  a  line starting with '^' has that character
              removed before it is passed to the spell-checking code.   It  is
              recommended  that programmatic interfaces prefix every data line
              with an uparrow to protect themselves against future changes  in
              _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l.

              To summarize these:



              *      Add to personal dictionary

              @      Accept word, but leave out of dictionary

              #      Save current personal dictionary

              ~      Set parameters based on filename

              +      Enter TeX mode

              -      Exit TeX mode

              !      Enter terse mode

              %      Exit terse mode

              `      Enter verbose-correction mode

              ^      Spell-check rest of line

              In _t_e_r_s_e mode, _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l will not print lines beginning with '*',
              '+', or '-', all of which indicate correct words.  This signifi‐
              cantly  improves running speed when the driving program is going
              to ignore correct words anyway.

              In _v_e_r_b_o_s_e_-_c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n mode, _h_u_n_s_p_e_l_l includes the original  word
              immediately after the indicator character in output lines begin‐
              ning with '*', '+', and '-', which  simplifies  interaction  for
              some programs.

              Example of the syntax:

       -d en_US,en_geo,en_med,de_DE,de_med

       en_US and de_DE are base dictionaries, they consist of aff and dic file
       pairs: en_US.aff, en_US.dic and de_DE.aff, de_DE.dic.  En_geo,  en_med,
       de_med  are special dictionaries: dictionaries without affix file. Spe‐
       cial dictionaries are optional extension of the base dictionaries  usu‐
       ally  with  special (medical, law etc.)  terms. There is no naming con‐
       vention for special dictionaries, only the ".dic" extension: dictionar‐
       ies  without affix file will be an extension of the preceding base dic‐
       tionary (right order of the parameter list needs for good suggestions).
       First item of -d parameter list must be a base dictionary.

       --PP ppaasssswwoorrdd
              Set password for encrypted dictionaries.


       --pp ddiicctt
              Set path of personal dictionary.  The default dictionary depends
              on the locale settings. The following environment variables  are
              searched:  LC_ALL,  LC_MESSAGES,  and LANG. If none are set then
              the default personal dictionary is $HOME/.hunspell_default.
